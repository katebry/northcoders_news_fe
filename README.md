### **About**

This repository contains the front-end code for a news website modelled on Reddit; it was created during my time at Northcoders.

The front-end of the website was built with React and feeds into code I previously created (see 'Project Links' for the link to the back-end repo). For the styling, I used a combination of Bootstrap, CSS and styled-components.

The site is fully responsive and can be viewed on a mobile, tablet or laptop.
